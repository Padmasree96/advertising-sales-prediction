# Advertising Sales Prediction ðŸ“ˆ

## Project Overview  
This project applies multiple linear regression to predict product sales based on advertising spend across three media channels: TV, Radio, and Newspaper. By modeling the relationship between these advertising budgets and sales, it provides insights to help optimize marketing investments.

## Libraries Used  
The analysis and model building use key Python libraries:  
- **pandas** and **numpy** for data handling and numerical operations  
- **matplotlib** and **seaborn** for data visualization  
- **scikit-learn** for constructing and evaluating the regression model

## How the Model Works  
The workflow involves preparing the dataset, exploring data patterns, selecting advertising budgets as input features, and training a multiple linear regression model to understand and quantify how each budget influences sales. The model is evaluated using statistical metrics that indicate how well it predicts actual sales, helping users assess the effectiveness of their advertising strategies.
